This repository contains the source code of the Data Verify Forwarder (DVF). It contains three files:
- `index.html`: The home page for the DVF. It's responsible for in-browser communication with IdP and RP and calls the RP validation functions in `dvf.xxxxx.js`.
- `dvf.xxxxx.js`: The RP verification script. This script is packaged by `webpack` to ensure optimal transmission over the web. The source code is available [here](https://github.com/ARPSSO/DVF-js).
- `README.md`: This file.
